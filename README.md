## CalculatorService
A simple example demonstrating the concepts of Service Endpoint Interface and Service Implementation Bean. This service uses simple XML data-types. To run this web-service, clean, build and run the main class. Download and import the SoapUI project to test this web-service.

## EmployeeService
An example demonstrating the usage of richer data-types which are programmer-defined; for instance a custom-bean or object. This service does not implement the SEI as in the CalculatorService to demonstrate that implementing the SIB directly without implementing the SEI is also an option; but not a good practice.
